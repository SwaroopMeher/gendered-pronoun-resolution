Pronoun resolution is part of coreference resolution, the task of pairing an expression to its referring entity. This is an important task for natural language understanding.

Goal is to build pronoun resolution systems that perform equally well regardless of pronoun gender by identifying the target of a pronoun within a text passage.

The final algorithm must be capable of deciding whether the pronoun refers to name A, name B, or neither.
